          While DIMO was in its earliest stages we built a number of
          proofs-of-concept without a formalized design system. With our debut
          flagship mobile app in its architecting phase, our design team came
          together to create its visual language.

            Dora, Daniel and I set up a period of weekly syncs to build the
            design system in parallel with the scoping and architecting of our
            upcoming mobile app. We began by compiling a series of reference
            systems to pull inspiration from including Base, Encore, DLS, and
            more. Eventually we settled on Base as a core reference point for
            its robust components and east-to-navigate file setup.

            We compiled examples and references for our existing components as
            well as ones we projected a use for in the app. From there we
            divided and conquered throughout the week, then did weekly peer
            reviews of one anotherâ€™s components to ensure they were up to
            standards and using the same naming and layout conventions.
